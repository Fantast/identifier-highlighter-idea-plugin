      Color Scheme

    <div style=" margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
      There are many different options relating to the colors used in the highlighting of
      identifiers. &nbsp;Each type of identifier can have its own active highlight color and
      regular highlight color. &nbsp;The active highlight color is used when the text cursor is
      placed on that instance of identifier. &nbsp;The regular highlight color is used for all
      other instances in the same file of that identifier.

    </div>
    <div style=" margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
      The types of identifiers that are supported are {Class, Method, Field, Parameter, and Local
      Variable}. &nbsp;Anything that doesn't fit into those types are considered Other. &nbsp;In
      addition to customizing the color for these different types of identifiers, the highlighting
      can be toggled on or off with the Enabled? checkbox.

      Read/Write
    </div>
    <div style=" margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
      Certain types of identifiers {Field, Parameter, and Local Variable} can be read or written to
      in the code. &nbsp;In other words, every time a new value is assigned to one of these special
      types of identifiers, it is considered a write. &nbsp;All other usages of these special types
      of identifiers are considered reads. &nbsp;The distinction between a read and write can
      further be customized with separate colors. &nbsp;This makes it easy to spot all places where
      a certain variable is changed in value.
